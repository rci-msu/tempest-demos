# Monte Carlo calculation of Pi

These examples calculate Pi using a Monte Carlo "dartboard" method. This serves as a simple example of [Monte Carlo methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method), which are common and are [embarrassignly parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel).

There are implementations in

- [python 📁](python)
- [R 📁](R)
